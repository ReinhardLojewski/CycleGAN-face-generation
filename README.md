# Face Generation

This Face Generation Project is part of the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree.

In this project, a DCGAN is trained on a dataset of faces. The goal is to get a generator network to generate *new* images of faces that look as realistic as possible!


### Keywords
* DCGAN
* Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
* CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA)

### Introduction
You can download this project using:  
`https://github.com/ReinhardLojewski/CycleGAN-face-generation`  
In the following the basic steps of this project are described. They can be found directly in the notebook (ipynb-file). 



### Step 1: Get the Data

You'll be using the [CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA)](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) to train your adversarial networks.

This dataset is more complex than the number datasets (like MNIST or SVHN) you've been working with, and so, you should prepare to define deeper networks and train them for a longer time to get good results. It is suggested that you utilize a GPU for training.

### Step 2: Pre-processed Data

Since the project's main focus is on building the GANs, we've done *some* of the pre-processing for you. Each of the CelebA images has been cropped to remove parts of the image that don't include a face, then resized down to 64x64x3 NumPy images. Some sample data is show below.

This is a zip file that you'll need to extract in the home directory of this notebook for further loading and processing. After extracting the data, you should be left with a directory of data `processed_celeba_small/`

###  Step 3: Visualize the CelebA Data

The [CelebA](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) dataset contains over 200,000 celebrity images with annotations. Since you're going to be generating faces, you won't need the annotations, you'll only need the images. Note that these are color images with [3 color channels (RGB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_(digital_image)#RGB_Images) each.

### Step 3.1: Pre-process and Load the Data

Since the project's main focus is on building the GANs, we've done *some* of the pre-processing for you. Each of the CelebA images has been cropped to remove parts of the image that don't include a face, then resized down to 64x64x3 NumPy images. This *pre-processed* dataset is a smaller subset of the very large CelebA data.

> There are a few other steps that you'll need to **transform** this data and create a **DataLoader**.

#### Exercise: Complete the following `get_dataloader` function, such that it satisfies these requirements:

* Your images should be square, Tensor images of size `image_size x image_size` in the x and y dimension.
* Your function should return a DataLoader that shuffles and batches these Tensor images.

#### ImageFolder

To create a dataset given a directory of images, it's recommended that you use PyTorch's [ImageFolder](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/datasets.html#imagefolder) wrapper, with a root directory `processed_celeba_small/` and data transformation passed in.

### Step 4: Create a DataLoader

#### Exercise: Create a DataLoader `celeba_train_loader` with appropriate hyperparameters.

Call the above function and create a dataloader to view images. 
* You can decide on any reasonable `batch_size` parameter
* Your `image_size` **must be** `32`. Resizing the data to a smaller size will make for faster training, while still creating convincing images of faces!

### Step 5: Define the Model

A GAN is comprised of two adversarial networks, a discriminator and a generator.

### Step 6: Discriminator

Your first task will be to define the discriminator. This is a convolutional classifier like you've built before, only without any maxpooling layers. To deal with this complex data, it's suggested you use a deep network with **normalization**. You are also allowed to create any helper functions that may be useful.

#### Exercise: Complete the Discriminator class
* The inputs to the discriminator are 32x32x3 tensor images
* The output should be a single value that will indicate whether a given image is real or fake


### Step 7: Generator

The generator should upsample an input and generate a *new* image of the same size as our training data `32x32x3`. This should be mostly transpose convolutional layers with normalization applied to the outputs.

#### Exercise: Complete the Generator class
* The inputs to the generator are vectors of some length `z_size`
* The output should be a image of shape `32x32x3`

### Step 8: Initialize the weights of your networks

To help your models converge, you should initialize the weights of the convolutional and linear layers in your model. From reading the [original DCGAN paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf), they say:
> All weights were initialized from a zero-centered Normal distribution with standard deviation 0.02.

So, your next task will be to define a weight initialization function that does just this!

You can refer back to the lesson on weight initialization or even consult existing model code, such as that from [the `networks.py` file in CycleGAN Github repository](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/blob/master/models/networks.py) to help you complete this function.

#### Exercise: Complete the weight initialization function

* This should initialize only **convolutional** and **linear** layers
* Initialize the weights to a normal distribution, centered around 0, with a standard deviation of 0.02.
* The bias terms, if they exist, may be left alone or set to 0.


### Step 9: Discriminator and Generator Losses

Now we need to calculate the losses for both types of adversarial networks.

### Discriminator Losses

> * For the discriminator, the total loss is the sum of the losses for real and fake images, `d_loss = d_real_loss + d_fake_loss`. 
* Remember that we want the discriminator to output 1 for real images and 0 for fake images, so we need to set up the losses to reflect that.


### Generator Loss

The generator loss will look similar only with flipped labels. The generator's goal is to get the discriminator to *think* its generated images are *real*.

#### Exercise: Complete real and fake loss functions

**You may choose to use either cross entropy or a least squares error loss to complete the following `real_loss` and `fake_loss` functions.**

### Step 10: Optimizers




### Step 11: Training

Training will involve alternating between training the discriminator and the generator. You'll use your functions `real_loss` and `fake_loss` to help you calculate the discriminator losses.
